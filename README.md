## A practice project to learn & differenciate between Specification & crieteria builder with regular JPA offered qaueries. 
- There are some api (mentioned below) implemented using both JPA offered queries and by using SPEC & CB. 
- A service class `ProductService` includes methods declared for different types of product retrieval.
